# Animated-Feature-Films-Map

This is the final project for Japan 360: Japanese Anime Feature Films taught by Professor [Benjamin DeTora](https://asian.washington.edu/people/benjamin-detora) at the University of Washington. This project aims to visualize the significant places in the films we watched throughout the quarter and to provide a brief description and the backstory of those scenes.
